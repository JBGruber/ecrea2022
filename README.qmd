If you are tired of scrolling through the [ECREA program](https://www.czech-in.org/cmPortalv15/Searchable/ecc22/config/nodetails#!sessionlist) or waiting for the page to load, this repo is for you.^[idea nicked from [benjaminguinaudeau's APSA repo](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/apsa2022).]

This repo contains the full programme as json, CSV and Excel file in the data folder and the [quarto file](ecrea.qmd) I used to scrape and tidy the data.
I also selected the most important columns from this full data and this [Excel file](https://github.com/JBGruber/ecrea2022/raw/main/data/ecrea_presentations_short.xlsx) is what I would recommend you to search through:

## Finding my Twitter friends in the programme

I always look for a couple of keywords in the programme to find the presentations I'm most interested in.
But conferences are, of course, also the place to network and meet academia friends after two years only seeing each other online :smiley:.
So another good way to navigate the programme is to look for people I follow on Twitter in the programme:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(rtweet)
library(glue)
# look up friends
friends <- rtweet::get_friends("JohannesBGruber") %>% # enter your Twitter handle here
  dplyr::pull(to_id) %>%
  rtweet::lookup_users() %>% 
  pull(name) %>% 
  toString()

presentations <- rio::import("data/ecrea_presentations_short.xlsx")

presentations %>% 
  filter(str_detect(friends, glue("\\b{presentation_FirstName}\\b")),
         str_detect(friends, glue("\\b{presentation_LastName}\\b")))
```
