The above defined negative aspects of our publishing culture have been perceived by the task force team as inseparable from the neoliberal academia and its publish or perish culture and the gradual dominance of business approach to scientific publishing since the beginning. <br />During its existence, the task force identified three main areas that need to be addressed in detail if communication scholars want to promote and protect the highest standards in academic publishing. First, whereas predatory publishing has been reflected thoroughly and condemned by the scholarly community, it may still be difficult for many of us to identify similar strategies of the so-called grey zone publications and prevent publishing with them. Second, open access publishing principles seem to offer a solution to the problem of inequal access to information sources but, at the same time, represent an economic burden to the authors of scientific papers, mainly those from endangered economies. Third, co-authorship rules should be discussed in academia to prevent situations in which power relations influence the inclusion and position of co-authors, typically in papers co-authored by supervisors or high-profile scholars. <br />All these aspects of academic publishing will be discussed by our presenters from various perspectives, including the position of publishers of scientific journals.
